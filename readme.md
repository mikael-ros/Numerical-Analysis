# Notes, anki cards, and exercise solutions for Numerical Analysis
> second edition, Timothy Sauer

This repository contains my attempts to solve the exercises given in the aforementioned book, during my enrolment in the Numerical Analysis course (FMNF05) at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola (LTH) @ Lund University : Lund, Sweden - as part of my computer science program.

It also includes my notes, and you can find my [anki cards here](https://www.github.com/mikael-ros/LTH-anki/Y3/P3/FMNF05/Book).

Feel free to submit an issue, or contact me, if you discover any errors or have intellectual property rights concerns. 

This repository is part of a wider project of mine, to document my notes and exercises throughout my university degree. You can find more [here](https://mikaelrr.notion.site/Delade-anteckningar-Hub-LTH-D-C-f2a47297b9b146dba372e02c4f789d55?pvs=4) :)

## Running locally
If using this repository I strongly recommend installing MATLAB locally, and opening the repository in Visual Studio Code. Using the following command, after opening a terminal in Visual Studio Code, you can run MATLAB inside of Visual Studio Code:
```sh
matlab -nodesktop -nojvm -nosplash
```
> [!TIP]
> Add the above command as some alias in Linux, by adding ``alias matlab-console = "matlab -nodesktop -nosplash"`` to your ``~/.bashrc`` (or applicable for your shell) and then running ``source ~/.bashrc``.

Additionally, using the recommended extensions, you can open relevant ``.pdf`` files and split your view for efficiency.

To run any function, start your MATLAB terminal, then ``cd`` into the directory and simply write the name of the file without the ``.m`` extension.
