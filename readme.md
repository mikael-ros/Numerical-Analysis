# Exercise solutions for Numerical Analysis
> second edition, Timothy Sauer

This repository contains my attempts to solve the exercises given in the aforementioned book, during my enrolment in the Numerical Analysis course (FMNF05) at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola (LTH) @ Lund University : Lund, Sweden - as part of my computer science program.

Feel free to submit an issue, or contact me, if you discover any errors or have intellectual property rights concerns. 

This repository is part of a wider project of mine, to document my notes and exercises throughout my university degree. You can find more [here](https://mikaelrr.notion.site/Delade-anteckningar-Hub-LTH-D-C-f2a47297b9b146dba372e02c4f789d55?pvs=4) :)
