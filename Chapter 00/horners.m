% Nested multiplication
% Evaluates polynomial from nested form using Hornerâ€™s Method
% Input: 
% - degree d of polynomial,
% - array of d+1 coefficients c (constant term first),
% - x-coordinate x at which to evaluate, and
% - array of d base points b, if needed
% Output: value y of polynomial at x
function y=horners(d,c,x,b)
    if nargin<4, 
        b=zeros(d,1); 
    end
    y=c(d+1);
    for i=d:-1:1
        y = y.*(x-b(i))+c(i);
    end
